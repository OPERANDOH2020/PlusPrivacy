**Start Collecting Leads Anywhere on Your Website**

Email subscribers lets you collect leads from anyplace on your website. You can either directly insert the subscription form as a shortcode, show it as a widget or simple add it to your site’s theme using php.

*   **Shortcode for any posts or pages**

`[email-subscribers namefield="YES" desc="" group="Public"]`

*   **Widget option**

Go to Appearance -> Widgets. Drag and drop the Email Subscribers widget to your desired location.

*   **Add directly in the theme**

Add following line of PHP code directly in your theme :
`es_subbox( $namefield = "YES", $desc = "", $group = "" );`

> **Great Plugin** -
> Works as expected. Great way to build an email list on your own site. It allows my clients to manage their own lists via login. I love the automatic notifications to subscribers when new posts are created. Looking forward to a “premium” paid version that includes email templates.
> - [jj9617](https://wordpress.org/support/topic/great-plugin-10646/)

**Send Automated Emails as soon as a New Blog Post is Published**

As soon as you publish a new blogpost, email subscribers will automatically send the people on your list a notification, informing them about the new blogpost.

> **Great product and support** -
> I highly recommend this product. It does everything it says it will do, is easily adaptable to your website, and Mansi’s level of support is fantastic. Unlike some of the other similar plugins, this one gives you total control over who requests to subscribe to your newsletter or blog.
